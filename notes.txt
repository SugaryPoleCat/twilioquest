When copying ngrok public IP link and pasting it in webhooks, rememebr to look at:
app.route and @app/route in py or js, as that is the PATH that the ngrok server will look at.
So when copying the adress, if this is a SMS webhook, add at the end /sms to point to the right route in the application code.


Start ngrok with `ngrok http PORT` where PORT is the port you wish to use.
Then in the applications, configure the PORT variable to MATCH ngrok PORT. 
So if you launch ngrok http 8767, make sure your py and js programs ALSO start on 8767 port, otherwise you will get 502 error.
